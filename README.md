# Voip Check

Easily check the call quality of your phone number.

## Why?

Sometimes a voip/phone app may be acting up. Rather than ask a friend if you can call
them to troubleshoot your line, call Voip Check instead.

## How's it work?

Voip Check uses [Twilio ](https://www.twilio.com) to configure our phone number to say
a few words and then record your voice and play it back to you. Easily check if you can hear
and speak clearly over your phone.

## What do you do with the recordings the app makes?

They are deleted immediately. [source](https://github.com/sprice/voip-check/blob/master/server.js#L70)

## I have an idea of how this could be better. What can I do?

Great! Feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/sprice/voip-check/issues/new) or submit
a [pull request](https://github.com/sprice/voip-check/pulls).
